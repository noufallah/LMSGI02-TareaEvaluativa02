          <p>At last! The highly anticipated sequel to the hit fantasy novel and comic Solo Leveling!

In a world of gates, monsters, and hunters galore, Sooho Sung is…well, he's just an ordinary college student. Sure, his parents went missing right before the gates started appearing three years ago, and he occasionally had a weird dream where he could battle monsters and level up like a video game, but other than that? There's absolutely nothing special about him. So when a sudden monster outbreak occurs on his campus, he must fight back every instinct screaming at him to run away as he takes a page out of his dad's book and rushes to save his cornered classmate. The chances of making it alive are looking bleak, until—PING! [Congratulations on becoming a Player.]</p>

          <p>Manta continues to be the go-to for romance and romantasy webcomics with the delectably named A Wicked Husband by Saha, a title that sounds like a tease, a promise, a threat, or all three. And like many good romance novels – here translated to comics with that extra Korean manhwa flavour, this series is certainly all tease. Teasing is a major attraction for romances as long as the payoff is satisfying, and when have Korean romances and melodramas ever failed to deliver? That's the magic formula for the genre. Here we have a heroine forced to marry a prince that she may or may not be attracted to, though it looks like there are plenty of other men who might be into her. Every straight girl should have that problem, maybe?</p>
